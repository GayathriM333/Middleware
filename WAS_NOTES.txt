 Websphere To Tomcat migration process:(issues that we faced is 500 error)
The idea is to migrate with keeping the same level of J2EE or it could break somethings like deprecated methods etc..
- first check Java versions on both sides, probably use the same versions even they are coming from different companies(IBM,oracle).
Analyze Dependencies: Identify Java EE features used by your application, such as EJBs, JMS, JPA, or web services.Tomcat supports servlets, JSP, and basic web applications.
- check J2EE versions supported by IBM Websphere, choose tomcat accordingly.
- ...Download and install the appropriate version of Tomcat for your application’s Java version., copy your application to webapps directory.(Ensure your application package is compatible with Tomcat’s WAR structure)
- you might have some libraries to copy in lib directory(jdbc etc) -----Define context.xml files for JNDI resources, database connections, etc.
nclude necessary dependencies in the lib directory or within the application’s WEB-INF/lib folder. web.xml: Ensure the deployment descriptor matches Tomcat's requirements. Remove WebSphere-specific entries.
Convert WebSphere-specific JNDI configurations to Tomcat’s format in context.xml.---->Resource name="jdbc/MyDB"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="20"
          maxIdle="10"
          maxWaitMillis="-1"
          username="dbuser"
          password="dbpass"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
          url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb" />
- check tomcat logs particularly catalina.out to see the deployments result.
-----> There is no IHS for tomcat, you will edit some files. these files should be considered(server.xml- where you define listening port, attributes, setenv.sh - place where you declare JVMoptions like Java_home, memory settings such as heap,log verbosity like printGC details...(issue xloggc got deprecated so got issue)

****What is websphere: platform which provides infrastructure to run the business applications. Middleware act btw frontend and backend
****Difference between appserver and webserver: Webserver allows clients to visit pages in the browser(HTTP requests are handled by this, provides security. it mainly for static content like webpages.
Appserver handles tasks like processing client requests, managing sessions, and facilitating communication with databases or other resources
****what is was and how it is differ from other appservers: application server from IBM, designed for running enterprise Java applications. It differs from other application servers by offering features like advanced transaction management, strong security, and integration with other IBM WebSphere products, making it suitable for large, complex deployments
****explain architecture of Websphere and its components: 
three-tier architecture: presentation tier is the user interface and communication layer,where end user interacts with application. Its main purpose is to display information & this toplevel tier can run on a web browser. basically provides userinterface.usually a webpage and the content can be static or dynamic
application tier also known as logic tier.in this information that is collected in presentation tier is processed by user inputs using business logic.
database server is the data or backend tier of web application. it runs on db management softwares.
****when user hit the url, the request goes to webserver and display the static content. if is of dynamic content then the request will be taken to app server by webserver and communication happens by plugin. then app server process the request based on user inputs and then collects the data which is in dackend tier i.e,DB at last displays the output
****Network deployment 
- is clustered environment where multiple  application servers are managed as single domain by Deployment manager.this architecture is used for large scale deployments, particularly those requiring high availability and scalability.
Clustering: multiple app servers are grouped together to form cluster,allowing for load distribution and redundancy. horizontal clustering refers to deploying multiple application servers across different physical machines (nodes) to increase scalability and availability. Vertical clustering, on the other hand, involves running multiple application servers on the same physical machine
DMGR:A central administrative agent that manages entire cluster and provides a unified view of all managed nodes
Nodeagents: responsible for configuration synchronization between the Deployment Manager and the Node
cell: a logical grouping of one or more application servers, managed together by a central administration console
Nodes: They are individual physical or virtual machines where application servers reside
diff btw cell and cluster: A cell can contain multiple clusters and nodes. A WebSphere cluster is a group of two or more application servers that work together
****What is the difference between load balancer and failover cluster? Load balancing distributes request processing across multiple servers. Failover redirects requests to alternate servers if the originally requested server is unavailable or too slow
****Types of profiles:
profile: it defines the runtime environment. profile includes all the files that the server processes in run time env 
cell profiles: creation of cell profile generates a dmgr and federated node in one iteration through the profile management tool. 
custom profiles: it does not include default applications or a default server like app serverprofile.  add the node to the deployment manager cell.then you can use the administrative interface of deployment manager to customize managed node by creating clusters and application servers.
application server profile: ability to scale up a standalone application server profile by adding application server node into deployment manager cell. multiple applicationserver processes in a cell can deploy an application that is in demand
management profile: these profiles manage aspects of the server such as DM,Administering agents,job management.
Secure proxy profile: use secure proxy server to take requests from internet and forward them to application server resides in DMZ
deployment manager server: basic function of deployment manageris to deploy application to a cell of application servers,which it manages. each application server that belongs to cell is managed node{{{{these profiles are created and managed by profile management tool or manageprofiles cmd}}}
***how to create dmgr profile cmd:./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName Dmgr01 -profileType DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profiles/Dmgr01 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/profileTemplates/management -adminUserName admin -adminPassword admin123
create app server profile:  /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profiles/AppSrv01-./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName AppSrv01 -profileType APPLICATION_SERVER -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profiles/AppSrv01 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/profileTemplates/default -adminUserName admin -adminPassword admin123
custom profile does not include app server and federation required. adding a node to an existing distributed environment managed by dmgr
(look at the DAC setup)

WAS INSTALLATION:
before WAS8 - update installer and after WAS8 we have IBMIM.
first we install base version - 8.5.5.0 then we do fixpack upgrade (for this we need min 10GB space, running instances, AF (curl cmd),offerings-natives-repository.config-repository.xml(head cmd to get productid)
we can -log /tmp at last imcl cmd so that the logs get generated.aboutthisfile.txt,versioninfo.sh(installation path), to check the status of the FP we get historyinfo.sh under appserver/bin
now we create profiles-bin directory-manageprofiles.sh ->dm,node-node federation node/bin will be created-cluster creation 2 nodes - jms, dbclasspath jar, jndiunique,samename we use in datasource **troubleshooting of testconnectivity(rename jndi)
---managesdks,deployment-installed apps   **host not found = virtual host (dns or webserver hostport, context root& logs path in jvm scope in websphere variables.

---was 8.5.5.18 to 22 -java 1.7 is not compatible
first backupprofile.sh & was85 folderbkp, stopnodecmd/kill,clearclasscache,OSGcfgninit(conf initialization)------node/bin&&dm/bin -->logschecks if nodeagent is not up, IM version 1.8to1.9
bug fixes, security, performance.

dmgr- generate - plugincreate- dmgr file && propagate = copy to paste in webserver from dmgr.

plugin file - jvm name ,clusters, virtual hosts, ports,app names,contextroot, 404, virtual host not found

issues:  port conflict issues,jndi names under same cluster,multiple applications can be deployed but contextroot must be diff
resources.xml under profile/cluster scope, security.xml(cert update, db id and pswd),server.xml(nodes scope- heap size)
-exchangesigners(dmgr - node)
IO exception- certs add ( root separately and personal certs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
troubleshooting issues process- check logs, details like any recentchanges,reboot, slow application, check working region,intermittent issue, flow, db down, trace logs

1.introduce yourself :
Hi everyone, Thank you for giving me this opportunity to be interviewed for this position today.My name is gayathri, I have completed my graduation in 2019. 
I was placed in campus placements right after my graduation.I have overall 6 years of IT experience. Previously i have worked as websphere admin in wipro citibank as myclient 
and from past3 years i have been working with cognizant AIG as my client and i'm working on was, tomcat and also supporting datapower and MQ 
I involved in major WAS lift and shift  migration from on prem to cloud servers. I have been doing tomcat upgrades lately. also supporting all the BAU activities.
Having said that, im confident i have skills and qualities to excel in the role as i can manage significant workload.
I am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your organization and support its middleware infrastructure.
thank you

2.explain request flow ? whenever user makes request for example www.abc.com then request will be forwarded to DNS.  DNS will forward request to LB. LB will send the request to webserver. 
now if the request is looking for static content like html pages or images then webserver itself gets the response. if it is looking for dynamic content like webserver routes that request to corresponding appserver with the help of plugin
at the time of webserverstartup, it loads httpd.conf file and it contains path of plugincfg.xml file. this file contains all the details of app servers. so that webserver forwards request to app servers
app servers has 2 containers- web container and EJB containers--->if request is looking for web resources like servlets,html etc webcontainers itself generate response.  
and if it is looking for ejb resources like session beans etc thatrequest will be forwarded to ejb container through jndi. if requestrequired database interaction then it will go to connection pool, connection object once transaction is completed then it will return to pool.
finally request forward from webcontainer to webserver and webserver to end user

3. day to day activities - we mostly work on deployments, scheduled restarts, data source creations, configuration changes in tomcat, SSL renewals and troubleshooting. 
I majorly on WAS fixpack upgrades and tomcat upgrades.

4. how do i install was? i have only worked on was8 and 9.
first we have to check the pre-req was8 we have installation manager 
linux version (8.10) - to know the version (uname -a)(cat /etc/os-release)  --------8 GB RAM and 10GB disk space, 
if this is fixpack then 8.5.5.18 to 8.5.5.22 - doesnt support java 1.7
take backup of wasprofile / backupprofile.sh - under appserver bin/ ---------./backupProfile.sh -profileName AppSrv01 -backupFile /backup/location/AppSrv01Backup.zip
stop the jvm, check the existing version
./managesdk.sh -listEnabledProfileAll && ./managesdk.sh -enableProfileAll -sdkname 1.8.64 & syncnode
 now go to home directory - etc/.ibm/registry  - cat installationManager.bat(to get imcl path ) like home/usradmin/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools - verify imcl is there or not
 ./imcl ListInstalledpackges------kill all services at a time -----./imcl uninstall 7.0.1.0-WS-WASJAVASDK7-linuxs39064-IFPH34273 -installationDirectory /opt../Appserverbin -sVP
 verify java 1.7 packages are uninstalled.
---->issue**-/export/opt/was85dev/websphere/Apsserverbin/bin/sdk/_setupsdk1.7_64.sh - no such file or directory
resolution - /opt/soft/was85dev/websphere/AppserverBin/properties/sdk/   -----> vi cmdDefaultSDK.properties now  change COMMAND_DEFAULT_SDK=1.8_64_bundled
chnaging java version ->./managesdk.sh -enabledprofile -profilename apacds85 -sdkname 1.8.64
now cmd for fixpack - ./imcl install <offeringID_version> -repositories <repository.config file path> -installationDiectory <appserverbinpath> -acceptLicense -showverboseprogress












5. types of deployments
6. linux commands
7. jndi, connection pool, default ports, heap size, dumps, logs, ssl cmds, ldap/global security, troubleshooting(WAS.pdf),virtual host/contextroot, plugin file generation cmd, paths, configuration files
